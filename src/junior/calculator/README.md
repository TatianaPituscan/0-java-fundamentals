# Calculator

Very simple calculator that can do basic operations with 2 operands

The purpose of the application is to put in practice things weâ€™ve been studied so far in the fundamentals section. 

The main flow of the calculator is: 
1. Run the application 
1. Provide first operand
1. Provide operation
1. Provide second operand
1. Receive the result

> You can do your own implementation as long it meet the requirements form the main flow.

The material for the calculator is to be studied from the video and source code

[YouTube [revisited]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHcRp9xwU)

Example source code is located under `src/junior/caculator`

The application is written from scratch to the deliverable .jar file. 
You can say you are done with the topic once you have the .jar file you can run from console just like in the video.

The content is making use of the **variables, statements, functions, classes, static elements**, in other words it prepare us to understand the concepts of so called OOP = Object Oriented Programming

Main topics are:
1. [Variables](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/variables.html)
    - [04. Variables.md](../../fundamentals/docs/04-Variables.md)
1. [Statements](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/flow.html)
1. [Functions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methods.html)
    - [05. Functions.md](../../fundamentals/docs/05-Functions.md)
1. [Collections](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/)
1. [Classes](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/)
    - [03. Classes.md](../../fundamentals/docs/06-Classes.md)
    - Simple use of static members
    - Note about the **static members** 
        - They are used just for a try. 
        - No best practices used nor explained.
        - The scope is to try them.
        - No more than that.
        - The detailed use of statics will be described when the material will need it (_never - most likely_)
